## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the final thesis titled **"Ethereum Rollups: Layer 2 Solutions for Scalability"**, which explores the scalability challenges of Ethereum and analyzes **Optimistic Rollups** as a promising Layer 2 solution to the blockchain trilemma.

The work includes both theoretical and experimental analysis, comparing testnets such as **Optimism** and **Arbitrum** using real-world scenarios and performance metrics.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand the blockchain scalability trilemma (scalability, security, decentralization)
- Study different Layer 2 approaches (State Channels, Plasma, zk-rollups, Optimistic Rollups)
- Implement and test Layer 2 solutions using public testnets
- Analyze performance, costs, and throughput
- Document technical and architectural insights

- ## 🗺️ Architecture Overview

To better understand the system, I created the following image to represent the general topology of a rollup architecture within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## 🧪 Technologies & Tools

- Ethereum
- Solidity
- Optimism & Arbitrum testnets
- Sepolia (Layer 1)
- Metamask
- Etherscan
- Go (Optimism stack components)
- Ganache (initial local setup attempt)

## 📂 Structure

- `ETHEREUM_ROLLUPS_TFG_JJR_FINAL.pdf`: Full thesis (English, 100+ pages)
- `README.md`: Summary and context of the project

## 📈 Key Findings

- Optimistic Rollups significantly reduce gas costs and improve throughput
- Real-world testnets provide valuable insights but also present technical limitations
- Proper data compression (e.g., blobs vs calldata) plays a major role in scalability
- Despite some testnet challenges, Optimistic Rollups remain the most balanced current L2 solution

## 📣 Acknowledgements

Special thanks to **Jesús Correas Fernández**, for his support, guidance and dedication throughout the project.
